This paper introduce how Hchain plan to decentralize and onboard patients and hospitals into the Hchain protocol. 

## Why Blockchain and Decentralizition?
Hospitals don't have to have down time due to the fact, patients data will be requested and decentralization using blockchain will lead to no downtime due to the fact different node are always available to present the data. 

## why not centralized server?
over time cerntralized server has showed that once the server is down, the whole application is down. Hospital is a delicate business that ought to be up with no down time due to the urgency that comes with emergencies

## 1. Introduction

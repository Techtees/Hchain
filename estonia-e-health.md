## Estonia E-health
Estonia is the first country in the world to launch an EHR system registering all the patients’ data from birth till death
Since 2008, ‘hash-linked time-stamping’ has been used in the public and private sector. 
used the Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) blockchain science to make the health records impenetrable.
The essential reason for KSI is the exclusive use of hash-function cryptography which gives records validation rather than dependence on other centralized trust authorities. 
In 2016, Estonian e-health foundation launched a blockchain technology to secure the health records of the patients.

Blockchain secures online health records by making information immutable. Hackers will not be able to make any changes in the data. All the Digital transactions made with Blockchain technology are recorded irreversibly. The records are difficult to change since they are shared across many computers in real time through a distributed ledger, globally. 

X-Road is a centrally managed distributed Data Exchange Layer (DXL) between information systems.[1][2] Organizations can exchange information over the Internet using X-Road to ensure confidentiality, integrity and interoperability between data exchange parties
